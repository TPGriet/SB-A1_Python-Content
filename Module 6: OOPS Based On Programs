•	Fields representing the name and price of the item
•	A constructor that sets those fields,
•	A str() method that returns a string containing the item name and price, with the price formatted to exactly 2 decimal places

TEST CASES:
---------------------------
case=t1
input=study table
5000
output=
Name: study table
Price: 5000.00

item = Item(name, price)

print(item)

4. Write a class called BankAccount that has the following fields:
    Name of account holder, balance and interest rate (between 8 to 15 as integer value indicating percentage).
•	A constructor that just sets the values of the three fields above.
•	A method  called  apply_interest() that  takes  no arguments  and  applies  the interest  to  the account. 
    It should just modify the amount field and not return anything.
    For example:
    if the account has Rs.1000 in it and the interest rate is 7%, then the amount variable should be changed
    to Rs.1070 (Rs.1000 + 7% interest).
    
    Then test the class, by creating a new BankAccount object for a user data entered on screen
    and do the following:
    
•	Use the apply_interest() method to apply the interest to the account.
•	Print out how much money is now in the account after applying the interest.
•	Change the account’s interest rate to 2%.
•	Use the apply_interest() method to apply the interest to the account again.
•	Print out how much money is now in the account after applying the interest again.

5. Write a class called ShoppingCart that might be used in an online store. It should have the following:
•	A list of Item objects that represents the items in the shopping cart.
•	A constructor that creates an empty list of items (the constructor should take no arguments except self)
•	A method called add() that takes a name and a price and adds an Item object with that name and price to the shopping cart.
•	A method called total() that takes no arguments and returns the total cost of the items in the cart.
 
•	A method called remove_items() that takes an item name (a string) and removes any Item
objects with that name from the shopping cart. It shouldn’t return anything.
•	A str () method that returns a string containing info on all the items in the shopping cart

Then test out the shopping cart as follows: Implement Menu drive python program:
(1) Insert Item.
(2) Find total cost of all items in the cart.
(3) Remove the items based on item name

6. Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. 
The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, 
we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. 
So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Note:You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.

TEST CASES:
-----------------------------------------
case=t1

        self.name = name
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.capacity = capacity

    def fare(self):
        return self.capacity * 100

class Bus(Vehicle):
    def fare(self):
        amount = super().fare()
        amount += amount * 10 / 100

7. Create a Parent class named as "Vehicle" which has fields name and color.
Create a child class named as "Car" which inherits properties name and color from parent class i.e it initializes instances using parent class.
Vehichle class has 2 methods:
1. Max_speed()-- where vehicle maximum speed is 150
2. gears()-- which indicates number of gears for vehicle.

Child class Car need to implement both above methods and change vehicle max speed as 250 and number of gears as 7.

Complete the program by reading name of vehicle and its details and car name and its details from the user.
Read parent class details first and print.
Next read child class details and print.
